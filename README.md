# Muon-detector Part 1: electronic-programing

**Project Idea**

The purpose of this mini project is to demonstrate, in one integrated system, how electronic components can be programmed and combined to operate as part of a muon detection instrumentation setup.

The system provides:
- Visual indication when the detector is active
- LED blinking during muon detection events
- Audible feedback via buzzer when detection occurs
- Environmental correction using temperature and humidity measurements

This project combines nuclear physics instrumentation principles with embedded electronics and microcontroller programming.
